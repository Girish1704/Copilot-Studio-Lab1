   - **X-axis**: Total Acceptances
   - **Legend**: team

      ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g23.png)

1. Review the chart — it should resemble the example below.

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g24.png)

1. Notice that when you click a **team** in the bar chart (1), the corresponding data in the **table visual** (2) automatically updates — showing interactive filtering between visuals.

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g25.png)

   > **Manager Insight**: This identifies your top Copilot users and shows team distribution, helping you identify champions for peer training.

### C. Create Technology Adoption Matrix

1. Insert a **Matrix** visual: in the **Visualizations (1)** pane, select the **Matrix (2)** icon; a **blank matrix visual (3)** will appear on the canvas.

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g26.png)

1. Configure the **Matrix** visual as shown below:  
   - **Rows (1):** editor_primary  
   - **Columns (2):** language_primary  
   - **Values (3):** Active Users, Acceptance Rate %  

      ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g27.png)

      > **Manager Value**: This shows which technology combinations are most successful with Copilot, informing training and tooling decisions.

### D. Add Interactive Filters

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g28.png)

1. Configure the **Slicer** visual: add **team (1)** and **role (2)** fields under **Field** to enable filtering by both attributes.

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g29.png)

1. Test the **Slicer** interactivity: select a **team (1)** and a specific **role (2)** — observe that all visuals dynamically update to reflect the selected filters.  

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g30.png)

1. Select another **team (growth)** from the **Slicer** to verify that all visuals update dynamically based on the selected filter. 

   ![](../media/mang-cor-ex1-g31.png)

   > **Manager Benefit**: These slicers allow you to drill down into specific teams or roles to understand adoption patterns and identify coaching opportunities.

## Notes

- Focus on trends rather than absolute numbers - adoption patterns are more important than raw usage counts
- Pay attention to acceptance rates by team/technology to identify where Copilot is working best
- Use this data to identify Copilot champions who can help train others
- Consider the experience level (role) when analyzing adoption - senior developers might use chat more while junior developers might rely more on code suggestions

## Summary

In this exercise, you successfully transformed raw Copilot usage data into meaningful management insights through comprehensive adoption and engagement analysis. You created strategic measures that help managers identify high-performing teams, understand technology preferences, and spot areas where additional support or training may be needed. The interactive dashboards you built provide the foundation for data-driven decisions about Copilot program optimization. These adoption metrics will now serve as the baseline for measuring productivity improvements in the next exercise, creating a complete picture of Copilot's organizational impact.
