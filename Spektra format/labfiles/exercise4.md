## Notes

- **ROI focuses on time savings** - the primary quantifiable benefit of Copilot for development teams
- **Use parameters** to make the dashboard adaptable to different organizations and scenarios
- **Separate technical details** from executive summary - executives need the "so what" not the "how"
- **Include payback period** - executives want to know when they'll see returns
- **Show team-level results** - helps identify where additional training or support might be needed
- **Consider additional benefits** like improved code quality, reduced bugs, and developer satisfaction in narrative

## Summary

In this exercise, you created a comprehensive executive dashboard that transforms Copilot usage data into clear business value metrics. You calculated ROI based on productivity improvements, created scenario analysis capabilities, and published the results to Power BI Service. This dashboard provides executives with the data-driven insights needed to make informed decisions about Copilot expansion and optimization across the organization.
